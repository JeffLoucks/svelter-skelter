## Welcome to Svelte Basics!

This is a repo full of bugs and challenges for you to solve to learn the basics of modern SSR apps through SvelteKit. Yay! I'll leave breadcrumbs throughout the project to help you figure out what to do. Of course, you can always reach out to Jeff if you get really stuck. There may be some frustrating parts to this project because it's not connected to a database and nothing persist (just like in life) after a refresh. I suppose I could have thought of a better way to do that, but it's too late now!

## Challenge 0

Before we can start, you really gotta tell me who you are. I mean, we can't have just ANYONE learning Svelte. Look at the hooks.server.js file and see how we're trying to identify you. Fix that, and we can start really getting this working!

## Challenge 1

Oh my! There seems to be a problem loading our journal entry. Can you fix the data loader to make sure the data is properly getting sent to the page?

## Challenge 2

Now that you've got the data loader working, a new entry foe has appeared. It appears to be a empty journal entry, and some... kind... of ... FORM!? EGADS!!

Can you fix the form and connect it to a form action, and send the data to the component?

## Challenge 3

Well, you're a friggin' pro now. I guess it's time to think of how you're going to rule the planet now that you're an all powerful Svelte developer. Read the final journal entry to see where to go next.

## How to run this joint

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
